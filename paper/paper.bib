   abstract  = {Organic, polymeric, and inorganic nanomaterials with radially diverging dendritic segments are known for their optical, physical, chemical, and biological properties inaccessible for traditional spheroidal particles. However, a methodology to quantitatively link their complex architecture to measurable properties is difficult due to the characteristically large degree of disorder, which is essential for observed property sets. Here, we address this conceptual problem using dendrimer-shaped gold particles with distinct stochastic branching and intense chiroptical activity using graph theory (GT). Unlike typical molecular or nanostructured dendrites, gold nanodendrimers are two-dimensional, with branches radially spreading within one plane. They are also chiral, with mirror asymmetry propagating through multiple scales. We demonstrate that their complex architecture is quantitatively described by image-informed GT models accounting for both regular and disordered structural components of the nanodendrimers. Furthermore, descriptors integrating topological and geometrical characteristics of particle graphs provide physics-based analytical relations to the nontrivial dependence of optical asymmetry g-factor on the particle structure. The simplicity of the GT models capable of capturing the complexity of the particle organization and related light-matter interactions enables the rapid design of scalable nanostructures with multiple functions.}

Here, we describe a nanocomposite material addressing these technological challenges that have been designed using blueprints from biomaterials that combine a similar set of properties. These composites are based on aramid nanofibers (ANFs), whose mechanical properties are complemented by the epoxy resins with strong adhesion to various surfaces. The nanoscale structure of the ANF/epoxy nanocomposite coating replicates the nanofibrous organization of human cartilage, which is known for its exceptional toughness and delamination resistance. The structural analogy between percolating networks of cartilage and ANF was demonstrated numerically using graph theory (GT) analysis. The match of multiple GT indexes indicated the near-identical organization pattern of cartilage and ANF/epoxy nanocomposite. When compared with the standard insulating material for bioelectronics, Parylene C, the ANF/epoxy nanocomposite exceeds its performance characteristics in respect to delamination resistance, interfacial adhesion, tissue biocompatibility, electrode cross-talk and inflammatory response. This study opens the possibility of GT-informed design of high-performance insulation materials suitable for different types of electronics for neural engineering and other biomedical applications. GT analysis also makes possible structural characterization of complex biological and biomimetic materials. While the design of the electronics for implantable devices has substantially advanced, the materials for their long-term insulation have not. Delamination of insulation materials constantly results in device failure. The essential problem of this field is finding a material that affords the combination of multiple contrarian properties that need to be resolved to afford future advances in this area. Here, we report a new nanocomposite material that combines durability, toughness, and flexibility, as well as excellent adhesion, biocompatibility, and low inflammatory response. This study opens the road for a large family of materials suitable for different types of implantable electronics for neural engineering and other biomedical applications.}

Their multifunctionality requires an ionically conductive and stiff electrolyte matrix material. For this purpose, a bi-continuous polymer electrolyte is used where a porous solid phase holds the structural integrity of the system, and a liquid phase, which occupies the pores, conducts lithium ions. To assess the porous structure, three-dimensional topology information is needed. Here we study the three-dimensional structure of the porous battery electrolyte material using combined focused ion beam and scanning electron microscopy and transfer into finite element models. Numerical analyses provide predictions of elastic modulus and ionic conductivity of the bi-continuous electrolyte material. Characterization of the three-dimensional structure also provides information on the diameter and volume distributions of the polymer and pores, as well as geodesic tortuosity.}

However, understanding nanovoids is challenging due to lack of imaging methods with the needed penetration depth and spatial resolution. Here, we integrate electron tomography, morphometry, graph theory and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation to study the formation of interconnected nanovoids in polymer films and their impacts on permeance and nanomechanical behaviour. Using polyamide membranes for molecular separation as a representative system, three-dimensional electron tomography at nanometre resolution reveals nanovoid formation from coalescence of oligomers, supported by coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. Void analysis provides otherwise inaccessible inputs for accurate fittings of methanol permeance for polyamide membranes. Three-dimensional structural graphs accounting for the tortuous nanovoids within, measure higher apparent moduli with polyamide membranes of higher graph rigidity. Our study elucidates the significance of nanovoids beyond the nothingness, impacting the synthesis‒morphology‒function relationships of complex nanomaterials. Voids are known to impact the properties of materials, but the nanovoids also present are less well understood than macroscopic voids. Here, the authors utilise 3D imaging and graph theory to study nanovoid formation and impact on material properties.}

   abstract  = {The freud Python package is a library for analyzing simulation data. Written with modern simulation and data analysis workflows in mind, freud provides a Python interface to fast, parallelized C++ routines that run efficiently on laptops, workstations, and supercomputing clusters. The package provides the core tools for finding particle neighbors in periodic systems, and offers a uniform API to a wide variety of methods implemented using these tools. As such, freud users can access standard methods such as the radial distribution function as well as newer, more specialized methods such as the potential of mean force and torque and local crystal environment analysis with equal ease. Rather than providing its own trajectory data structure, freud operates either directly on NumPy arrays or on trajectory data structures provided by other Python packages. This design allows freud to transparently interface with many trajectory file formats by leveraging the file parsing abilities of other trajectory management tools. By remaining agnostic to its data source, freud is suitable for analyzing any particle simulation, regardless of the original data representation or simulation method. When used for on-the-fly analysis in conjunction with scriptable simulation software such as HOOMD-blue, freud enables smart simulations that adapt to the current state of the system, allowing users to study phenomena such as nucleation and growth. Program summary: Program Title: freud Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/v7wmv9xcct.1 Licensing provisions: BSD 3-Clause Programming language: Python, C++ Nature of problem: Simulations of coarse-grained, nano-scale, and colloidal particle systems typically require analyses specialized to a particular system. Certain more standardized techniques – including correlation functions, order parameters, and clustering – are computationally intensive tasks that must be carefully implemented to scale to the larger systems common in modern simulations. Solution method: freud performs a wide variety of particle system analyses, offering a Python API that interfaces with many other tools in computational molecular sciences via NumPy array inputs and outputs. The algorithms in freud leverage parallelized C++ to scale to large systems and enable real-time analysis. The library's broad set of features encode few assumptions compared to other analysis packages, enabling analysis of a broader class of data ranging from biomolecular simulations to colloidal experiments. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: 1. freud provides very fast parallel implementations of standard analysis methods like RDFs and correlation functions. 2. freud includes the reference implementation for the potential of mean force and torque (PMFT). 3. freud provides various novel methods for characterizing particle environments, including the calculation of descriptors useful for machine learning. The source code is hosted on GitHub (https://github.com/glotzerlab/freud), and documentation is available online (https://freud.readthedocs.io/). The package may be installed via pip install freud-analysis or conda install -c conda-forge freud.}
